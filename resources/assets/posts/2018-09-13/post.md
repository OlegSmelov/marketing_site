Sometimes when I present Monica to people unfamiliar with it, reactions range from `why would I ever need this?` to `it's sad that we are in an age where we need this kind of product to remember things about your friends`.

The homepage of the project states: this project is not for everyone. And I mean it. Monica is not like other products which claim to be for everyone or try to please most of the people. Monica was built initially for me, as a need to remember the name of the child or spouse of the friends who were moving out of the country to live somewhere else. Yes - it's a very specific use case but a real one. I'm a foreigner in the country I live in and most of my friends are also foreigners and sooner or later they move back to their countries of origin. Couple this need with a poor memory, and you end up with something like Monica.

Alright. So it makes sense to record information about people who you won't see a lot in the future. But what about close friends or family? Why would you need to log anything about them?

Monica lets you record a lot of different types of information. Recording which gifts you offered last year to your niece is very useful for instance. I don't need to be remembered the name of my brother's children. I know them, obviously. But as a matter of fact, adding them as contacts in Monica lets me link a gift with one of the child's name. That's it.

Monica is (surprisingly) used by communities of all sorts. Prison visitors, churches, societies. They need a tool to record what they know about people, and Monica seems to work well for them - which is totally awesome because I didn't create it for this use-case.

You might not need Monica. If you don't, that's great. If you do struggle with keeping track of what's going on in your social life, or in the social life of a group you belong to, Monica is right there. Open source, private, transparent.
